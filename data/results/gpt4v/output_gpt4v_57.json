        "response": "We describe the system as the cumin canister and the spring.\n\nIn the coordinate system shown, the direction of the canister's velocity is along the positive x-axis. However, the spring force is in the direction opposite to the spring's displacement. That is, when the spring is compressed to the left along the x-axis, the spring force on the canister is in the direction of the positive x-axis. We can say that the spring force is in the positive direction and the displacement is in the negative direction.\n\nBy the work-energy theorem, we can relate the initial kinetic energy of the canister to the work done on it by the spring (which is also the work done on the spring).\n$$K_{1}+U_{1-2}+W_{\\text { other }}=K_{2}+U_{2}$$\n$$\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+W_{\\text { spring }}=0$$\nThe canister's initial kinetic energy is\n$$K_{1}=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}=\\frac{1}{2}(0.40 \\mathrm{~kg})(0.50 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s})",

The ordering is given by the red number (roman numeral) in the upper right of the image below.  So, the 2nd composite image, for example, is given by taking the second image from the top row and the third image from the second row from the startrek chart.  \n\nThis means that the final image is given by taking the outside of the third image in the second row and the inside of the image in the bottom row.

Though option A also represents the comparisons, the experiment doesn\u2019t say anything about the thick layer of wax, therefore B is the correct option.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nSyria has been in a state of political unrest from 2011, but Bashar al-Assad has retained the presidency even after the election.

We can see that $9.29 + 12.51 > 21.5$. This is clearly more than the biggest bar. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }Yes}$. ~ MRENTHUSIASM\n\nAlternate Solution\n\nWe can see that 9.29 is really close to 9.3, and 12.51 is really close to 12.5. So, if we add these quantities together, we get 21.8. Since half of 20 is 10, we know that 21.8 has to be greater than 21.73. Notice that, this problem is relatively simple and we are allowed to get really rough estimates. We see that, the answer is $\\boxed{\\textbf{(A) }Yes}$. ~skyscraper\n\n\n2021 AMC",

Below are some examples.\nExample: The answer is 2! The first equation implies Circle + Square = 5. The second equation is Triangle + Triangle = 8 which is the same as 2 x Triangle = 8, so Triangle = 4. The third equation Circle + Triangle = 7 can be changed to Circle + 4 = 7, so Circle = 3. Substituting into the first equation 3 + Square = 5, we get Square = 5 \u2013 3 = 2.\nExample",
